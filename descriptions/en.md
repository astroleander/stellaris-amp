PS: Old Series is going to be remake so there won't be a title bar for them

----

Now should 100% adopt for new version 3.12.* with DLC, I removed legacy mod files (for 3.8.* and earlier) totally, hope it works now XP

For now I just simply copy portraits among Robot / Synthetics / Cybernetic / Machine. But hopefully can create separate portrait list for each.

----

For Portraits Mod Authors:
I remake this mod with 3.12 the newest structure, welcome to refer my work on[url=https://github.com/astroleander/stellaris-ammp]Github[/url] if you interesting on it. Also, there is a monkey-likely node-script to help generate portraits file, hope it helps.
